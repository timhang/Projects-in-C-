Countless technological breakthroughs made during the Apollo era have filtered into our lives today, from accurate satellite weather forecasts to the mobile phones in our pockets. Medical advances in osteoporosis treatment, digital mammography and food nutrition are all direct results of ongoing space research. The cost of the Apollo project was more than 100 billion US dollars in today’s currency. Nevertheless, it is currently [estimated](http://news.utexas.edu/2014/07/21/anniversary-shows-us-that-nasa-and-space-exploration-are-worth-their-costs) that for every dollar invested in the space programme, between $8 and $10 dollars’ worth of derivative benefits are added to the economy. This is the real argument in favour of sending humans to Mars, according to Cunningham.

He also acknowledged that the basic science would be fascinating as there is much that we still do not know about Mars, and that humans are far more efficient and creative than [pre-programmed rovers](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1943). But above all, he argued that our society owes it to itself and to future generations to keep pushing the frontier, in order to reap the unknown benefits in innovation and discovery.

“There is an obligation by humanity to push the next frontier,” said Cunningham. “The world is as good as it is today because of this.” As Cunningham said at the beginning of the talk, “500 years from now, people will only remember only thing about the [20th century:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century) that it was the century when man first left Earth.”
