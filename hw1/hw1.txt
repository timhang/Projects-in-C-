Problem 4
1. output:
1
2
3
4
5
Explanation: The function funcB will be called recursively 
until min = max which in this case is 0. So, it will output the 
first item in the a array which is 1. Then, the recursion goes up 
one level and will then execute funcB with min = 1 and max = 1. 
So 2 gets outputed. This will continue until the last of the 
function call when min=4 and max=4 is execute and 5 is outputed. 
Hence the output above.

2. when min>max, funcB will fail to terminate. funcB always terminate 
for other input values because when min<=max, the base case min==max 
will always get executed and the recursive calls will end eventually.

3. print out array items from index = min to index = max.
