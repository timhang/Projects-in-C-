Notes:

All files are in hw-weihangz/hw5 directory

Problems 1c,2, and 3a are in hw5.txt. 
Problem 3b is in hw5p3b.pdf

Problem 4 is a LengthMismatch exception and can be compiled
into a linker file for dummy main or Thanksgiving.cpp 
by typing "make LengthMismatch.o" into the terminal.

For Problem 5, the Thanksgiving linker file Thanksgiving.o  
can be compiled using the Makefile I provided
by typing "make" into the terminal.
Then, provide a dummy main file and compile with Thanksgiving.o
