Copy this entire folder to be under your hw8 folder (i.e. it should be at hw-username/hw8/hw8-check).

Run `make compile_check` to check whether each class compiles. There are four compilation tests and you need to pass all of them.

Run `make test` to run splay tree test.

Passing all compilation and functionality tests is not a guarantee of your score. However, failing any of the tests means you will likely lose significant points on the homework.
